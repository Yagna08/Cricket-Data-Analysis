Loopy ball and Shreyas was looking for the big wind-up to send him to Salt Lake Stadium from Eden, but the leggie spinning away from him gets a top edge and instead to of midwicket the ball swirls to long-off. Holder runs in from the boundary and has enough time to settle under it and grab it safely. Crucial strike, Shreyas was looking good.</span>. <strong>63/2</strong></div></div></td></tr><tr class=""><td class="ds-flex ds-items-center"><a href="/cricketers/dominic-drakes-906749" title="View full profile of Dominic Drakes" class="ds-inline-flex ds-items-start ds-leading-none"><span class="ds-text-tight-s ds-font-medium ds-text-typo ds-underline ds-decoration-ui-stroke hover:ds-text-typo-primary hover:ds-decoration-ui-stroke-primary ds-block">Dominic Drakes</span></a></td><td class="ds-w-0 ds-whitespace-nowrap ds-min-w-max ds-text-right">3</td><td class="ds-w-0 ds-whitespace-nowrap ds-min-w-max ds-text-right">0</td><td class="ds-w-0 ds-whitespace-nowrap ds-min-w-max ds-text-right">37</td><td class="ds-w-0 ds-whitespace-nowrap ds-text-right"><span class="ds-flex ds-items-center ds-cursor-pointer ds-justify-end ds-relative ds-text-typo ds-left-[14px]"><strong>1</strong><i class="icon-keyboard_arrow_down-outlined ds-text-icon-primary" style="font-size: 16px;"></i></span></td><td class="ds-w-0 ds-whitespace-nowrap ds-min-w-max ds-text-right">12.33</td><td class="ds-w-0 ds-whitespace-nowrap ds-min-w-max ds-text-right ds-hidden">5</td><td class="ds-w-0 ds-whitespace-nowrap ds-min-w-max ds-text-right ds-hidden">4</td><td class="ds-w-0 ds-whitespace-nowrap ds-min-w-max ds-text-right ds-hidden">2</td><td class="ds-w-0 ds-whitespace-nowrap ds-min-w-max ds-text-right">1</td><td class="ds-w-0 ds-whitespace-nowrap ds-min-w-max ds-text-right">0</td></tr><tr class="ds-hidden"><td class="" colspan="8"><div class="ds-text-tight-s ds-font-regular"><div class="ds-mb-2"><strong>13.5 to RG Sharma, </strong><span><strong>down the track, and he is bowled!</strong> Rohit's experiment at No. 4 ends with a 15-ball 7.
